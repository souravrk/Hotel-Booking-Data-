# Develop a Database to Analyze & Visualize Hotel Booking Data
# Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to your stakeholders.

# Questions to be amswered -
1. "Is our hotel revenue growing by year?" (We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.)
2. "Should we increase our parking lot size?â–º(We want to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars.)
3. "What trends can we see in the data?" (Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.)

# What we are going to do - hotel data we are going to source from a database that we will create uploading excel sheets to
  create a databse, we will connect this database to powerBI and answer some business questions and have a visual product at the end.

# Steps :-
1. Build a database (using MS SQL Server Studio) 
2. Develop the SQL Query for required data
3. Connect PowerBI to the database
4. Visualize the data
5. Summarize the findings


--SQL CODE for analysing data
# making one file from all 3 different indual files

with hotels as(
 select * from dbo.['2018$']
 union
 select * from dbo.[*2019$']
 union
 select *  from dbo.[*2020$'])
         

# is our hotel revenue(both hotels revenue) growing in year
making hotel revenue column

select 
	arrival_date_year,
	hotel,
	round(sum((stays_in_week_nights+stays_in_weekend_nights)*adr)2) as revenue 
	from hotels
	group by arrival_date_year, hotel

# Meal cost in the segment cost, join the market segment table to hotels table in a new column maket_segment

  select from hotels
  left join dbo.market_segment$
  on hotels.market_segment = market_segment$.market_segment
  left join dbo.meal_cost$
  on meal_cost$.meal =hotels.meal


SQL code is ready for all the questions we have to answer so now 
we will connect the PowerBI to our SQL server to impoert the data we have driven

# Now we will build visuals of given data to answer the question we have
1. Revenue , Average of Adr, total nights, average if discount in percentage, required car parking spaces
2. Graph of revenue by reservation_status_date and can be viewed for different countries for different hotels 
3. Graphs for Average of Adr, total nights, average if discount in percentage, required car parking spaces with date
   percentage of revenue for each hotels
4. Year and hotel vise table of revenue, required car parking spaces, parking percentage
   at last put a date slider for investigation
