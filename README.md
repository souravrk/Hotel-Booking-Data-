# Build a visual data story or dashboard using Power BI to present to your stakeholders.

# Questions to be amswered -
1. "Is our hotel revenue growing by year?" (We have two hotel types so it would be good to segment revenue by hotel type.)
2. "Should we increase our parking lot size?â–º(We want to understand if there is a trend is guest with personal cars.)
3. "What trends can we see in the data?" (Focus on average daily rate and guests to explore seasonality.)

# What we are going to do - hotel data we are going to source from a database that we will create uploading excel sheets to
  create a databse, we will connect this database to powerBI and answer some business questions and have a visual product at the end.

# Steps :-
1. Build a database (using MS SQL Server Studio) 
2. Develop the SQL Query for required data
3. Connect PowerBI to the database
4. Visualize the data
5. Summarize the findings

summary:- Revenue of both the hotels is growing. We calculated the parking space. We can see the trends of data in final result can also check it with date and
